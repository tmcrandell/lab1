trying out git
I can print the rgb values fine (what we did in class), and it changes with changes in the joystick and potentiometer. I am having trouble taking those values and putting them into an "acceptable" form for the .fill() method. I can use pygame fine, and fill in the screen manually, but taking the values from the serial port is perplexing me.
